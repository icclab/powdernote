POWDERNOTE
==========

Requirements:
-------------

PLEASE let us know if you have problems with the requirements, so we can write a better section here!

    Python (2.7)
    python-swiftclient

Install:
--------

After downloading the repo add this line to your ~/.bashrc file (or ~/.bash_profile, or whatever) to have powdernote in your PATH (replace <path_to_powdernote> with the path to the downloaded repo):

    export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_powdernote>/Powdernote/bin

Now add the credentials you've received to the Configuration.py file.

Now you can type powdernote -h to see the commands.

Have fun at being productive!
